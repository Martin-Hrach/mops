[00:32:25.687] Baconfang: i bet the servers will be almost dead because of the wipe coming. and new games which come out.

[00:33:03.553] FloppyWynnieTV: gotcha
[00:33:11.214] ANTS_SaViOr_: Prolly still a few weeks off for a wipe. We still need to get 10.2 first then the 10.5 wipe
[00:33:15.425] BigBonelessJerk: 0.10.2 - Around this time next week, no wipe. 0.10.5 - WIPE - Around the end of this month, 2 - 3 weeks from now
[00:33:20.648] R0B1N86: just fixes

[00:33:51.540] bcal_t1: 10.2 is the wipe yeah?
[00:33:55.964] herbologst: doesn't 10.2 fix invisible players and scavs?
[00:34:03.027] Damascus_404: bug wackamole
[00:34:11.882] Wimbles: they killed everyones buzz announcing the wipe so early
[00:34:21.907] fattestwhiteguyeverr: i agree
[00:34:25.992] MegaGigas: True
[00:34:31.304] MNK_TV_: scav boss monkaS
[00:34:32.589] Zerotheory: when is the player market stuff happening
[00:34:33.436] 740ii: theyve done that several times now
[00:34:35.883] herbologst: @Wimbles yeah true
[00:34:37.494] Wertgago: Epic gun fight incomingggggggg!
[00:34:41.166] ANTS_SaViOr_: I'm actually glad they are taking their time with the wipe and giving us optimizations first
[00:34:44.539] Baconfang: it will be a real game changer it will make it alot harder to solo.
[00:34:49.681] Jolly_CP: @Smoke is killing the scav boss as a scav a little OP?
[00:34:58.450] flybytim: they always announce too early and kill the game with events
[00:34:59.198] sixpieceso: pwease smoke, I wanna watch awwl tarkwov stweam pwease oh pwease 😩😩 @smoke
[00:35:02.807] arnorr1066: Holy hello that Boss Scav and gang like there nades.
[00:35:03.191] truetotheblue: @Jolly_CP scav boss agros on player scavs
[00:35:07.623] TheWoodMaterialNoob: that was close
[00:35:13.084] X_eroz: some people would have still been complaining if they had only given like a week notice
[00:35:14.344] Jabronie1canobie: smoketvHey smoketvHey
[00:35:20.215] fattestwhiteguyeverr: maybe 10.2 is scav boos at all maps?
[00:35:20.302] Jaadden: breakinskullz???
[00:35:22.438] Damascus_404: lolz
[00:35:25.120] Wertgago: Oh shit
[00:35:26.076] OmMandala: oh you were seein' him
[00:35:26.105] Jaadden: nvm
[00:35:28.222] Lithosysm: They just need to put objectives like that on every map. Would keep all the maps busy
[00:35:31.901] herbologst: @fattestwhiteguyeverr naw. They'd have listed it
[00:35:40.190] Zerotheory: @Smoke when is the player trading market happening?
[00:35:49.253] arnorr1066: They can't put the same boss on any other map Nikkita said they are tied to the map phsyics.
[00:35:56.598] 740ii: didnt they say something else about a newyears/xmas thing on the podcast today?
[00:35:56.742] victor_yoo: did they say anything about changing factory spawns or quests? because its really hard to do the quests even with hatchet
[00:35:57.430] LikyLawlliet: don't think this will happen... bots need training
[00:36:04.430] flybytim: killlla
[00:36:10.695] CharlesTravesty: I feel like the 100% scav boss event might have been better suited when they got more bosses done. Though, it helps make the game seem populated since everyone plays one map.
[00:36:15.005] herbologst: @arnorr1066 makes sense. advanced pathing is hard
[00:36:29.477] R0B1N86: I wish they added Rashala to every map, then replace him with new boses as they become ready.
[00:36:31.869] fattestwhiteguyeverr: nightraid baby
[00:36:34.291] JT23: good thing i decided to watch instead of go night customs
[00:36:34.435] ohitsangelo: will it be the same scav boss or will he be different?
[00:36:51.533] CharlesTravesty: @R0B1N86 Nikita said its impossible
[00:36:55.920] herbologst: @R0B1N86 that's a lot of work better suited to just adding new ones map by map
[00:37:00.981] arnorr1066: Each boss will be unique coded for there maps. it's a limitation in the engine.
[00:37:04.390] 740ii: armored addias mask guy
[00:37:08.403] R0B1N86: fair enough.
[00:37:13.907] WetYogaWolf: That voice line summed up the whole wipe situation "Never mind, we still have work to do"
[00:37:20.900] flybytim: one man army
[00:37:27.169] OmMandala: fuck dude. this game is going to get crazy
[00:37:37.566] CharlesTravesty: Because they'd have to code Reshala etc. to not run through walls on Interchange trying to follow the customs layout he's programmed for
[00:37:38.892] ohitsangelo: that will be cool then.
[00:37:44.203] Baconfang: scav boss and body guards in shore line resort for be fun.
[00:37:49.976] CharlesTravesty: Which is a lot of effort that could be used elsewhere
[00:37:51.878] Snarfindorf: Get into customs as a scav, first person I see shoots me. Scav-on scav ResidentSleeper
[00:38:00.198] Oh_its_Oliver: @CharlesTravesty i say let it happen, LUL
[00:38:09.516] CharlesTravesty: Thats a real bad look for the game
[00:38:13.256] CharlesTravesty: to have mobs running through walls
[00:38:15.692] xabun: @Smoke do you think night vision should be cheaper? it feels pretty off limits given how much you have to spend and it would make nights raids more popular maybe
[00:38:24.209] herbologst: @CharlesTravesty agreed
[00:38:27.661] xabun: or maybe make the awful AK scope better
[00:38:28.115] arnorr1066: Tera Group Labs will let them test new scav code... so expect those hunter kills scav squads to expand...

[00:39:09.864] xabun: well yeah interchange night raids are fine, factory/woods not so much
[00:39:19.371] Lithosysm: I've found a single bitcoin this patch. Trading with mechanic is hard
[00:39:19.760] arnorr1066: and Most of the time you don't need NVGs
[00:39:21.254] bcal_t1: So they extended wipe ?
[00:39:25.521] 740ii: true factory you do for sure @xabun
[00:39:30.762] R0B1N86: 1000 USD is nothing in tarkov lol

[00:39:54.865] Deearv: smoketvLurk smoketvHey
[00:39:56.791] TheOverSkilled: Or give them a chance to spawn on scavs at night. At least scav boss and cronies.
[00:39:57.431] unrulyf0x: anyone wanna group up
[00:40:00.126] fischboto: why my pee pee hard
[00:40:04.266] TheOverSkilled: That'd be a good source for NVG
[00:40:07.432] a_tactical_penguin_: maybe some different types of NV
[00:40:22.022] Strider114: how y'all doin?
[00:40:33.918] truetotheblue: they need to make sights unusable with nvgs
[00:40:38.577] xabun: I did give the AK NV scope a shot, it's kinda miserable to use
[00:40:44.437] archangelfalcon: smoketvLurk
[00:40:46.608] Strider114: he's runnin monkaS
[00:40:52.960] Hund: I've seen money spawn on the shelf in the back of that room. Right next to the window
[00:40:56.604] thebackup1: @truetotheblue some of them are in game. It says in the descriptions;)
[00:40:59.745] Hund: like 98$ or something
[00:41:02.612] Lithosysm: @truetotheblue At least with scopes, I agree
[00:41:02.646] Strider114: sup @Smoke hope the raids been good
[00:41:02.778] Baconfang: everyone i know said they have stopped playing because the wipe is soon and now its not :O

[00:41:24.792] TheOverSkilled: @fischboto Hows your aim?
[00:41:29.983] LegitHelio: like 3 weeks @apilotte
[00:41:31.349] flybytim: they just need to never announce wipe until they know the date and are 100% sure of it
[00:41:37.084] apilotte: tks
[00:41:40.310] fischboto: @TheOverSkilled its eh
[00:41:47.970] LikyLawlliet: @fischboto just modded my first, really liked it
[00:41:53.064] OmMandala: you should use it @fischboto
[00:41:55.392] arnorr1066: 3 weeks estimated in russian time.. so when 10.5 is ready
[00:41:56.347] herbologst: it might be a good idea to have the bot automatically give the info from the podcast when the word wipe is said maybe every 30s-1m
[00:41:57.402] TheOverSkilled: @fischboto If you can hit faces? Its not bad or with a 50 its usable even with shit aim.
[00:42:03.181] Snarfindorf: PepeHands No reason to play with wipe, 3 weeks away PepeHands

[03:35:14.243] kilrari: Everyone should be using 1.1.1.1 as their DNS anyway
[03:35:14.728] Mandibull: Guys it’s not dns, not twitch endpoint, restarting router probably wont fix it either.
[03:35:21.444] TheChickenDance: @smoke are business connections available for your area?

[04:04:43.402] bawlsmcnasty: so just asking but why is moving not a option?
[04:04:46.183] Andban92: What would you do if your max option were Download 25 Upload 2.8 ? LUL I'm that guy
[04:04:46.911] ZeroDezign: @Smoke Sounds like Fiber is for you for stability
[04:04:48.912] JiffTheJester: mine just cuts out and gets super horrible packet loss and then its back to perfect

And then you come back with a list of times that they havent met those requirements and have a specific request. "I would like a refund of the following days for this reason as outlined in my contract"
[04:06:11.027] SuigenGaming: @TheRedZealot unfortunately that does not always work becuase it will usually be worded in a way like 90%up time of promised speeds so if they average the time he is having problems to the full month it will be neglifable
[04:06:13.499] RynoDabs: no @mastermike96 its kind of dead because theres a wipe coming
[04:06:15.751] static2three: i demanded that verizon give me 2 free months because of their absolute terrible service. I went through exactly what youre going through, especially after looking up my account and how many times ive requested service or help, they absolutley provided 2 months free
[04:06:16.699] ZokAliPok: @mastermike96 lol no - nothing to do with that, it's pre-wipe season, dies down during this time
[04:06:17.983] Rako_TKO: @mastermike96 lmao no
[04:06:19.354] RynoDabs: but cod wont effect tarkov

[04:07:04.588] SquidleySpooch: 100%
[04:07:07.554] ZokAliPok: Tarkov feels empty when it doesn't feel like any of your stuff matters
[04:07:17.017] LazerChimera: Yeah for me I am excited for both Cod is a way better friends game more chill. and this game will still bust my balls
[04:07:21.799] dreggi: @mastermike96 no everyone is playing pokemon, cod is a dead game. everyone playing pokemon
[04:07:21.971] ZokAliPok: Still fun, but a lot different - Tarkov has phases
[04:07:23.451] UncleFoodCBC: @mastermike96 COD, like every year, is the flavor of the month <3
[04:07:23.542] SuigenGaming: everyone be mosining, and im using a sv98 with a bravo sight :D
[04:07:31.969] Jaysh145: @Smoke Im sure you've been asked 1000 times but is the wipe partial or is it a full wipe?
[04:07:35.031] DeanIV: ive been finding less players on interchange but they have consistently more gear
[04:07:37.830] Gunvash: @smoke I made a video on reflex sights and how they are off. may I post it?
[04:07:39.244] DeanIV: so still kinda fun
[04:07:40.420] Xiao20: Can't wait to upgrade on the 25% sale though
[04:07:41.897] bradswolf: Thought so. Just checking smoketvYou
[04:07:44.354] herb87: any idea when it updates this coming week??
[04:07:47.399] s4ndm4n1275: @Smoke Field Tech is talking out of his ass... Business ISP has dedicated servers and service. Plus you have static IP.

I went through exactly what youre going through, especially after looking up my account and how many times ive requested service or help, they absolutley provided 2 months free @Smoke
[04:07:58.769] SuigenGaming: I was having fun sniping from customs office in the warehouse, across the river people on the road
[04:08:03.371] suicide_george: @UncleFoodCBC COD has never done this well on Twitch; it might be more than that this time around
[04:08:14.796] bren_almighty: yo smoke gg bro
[04:08:15.030] ZokAliPok: @Smoke Yeah that's what I do, I usually wipe my account and try to fight geared dudes
[04:08:17.446] ZeroDezign: I bet if they get 1000 calls from some concerned Twitch viewers, they will do something about Smokes Internet Kappa
[04:08:29.779] NotShiggy: I just haven't played in a while because I missed playing for about two weeks and got really far behind, then heard about the wipe so I'm just waiting.
[04:08:32.998] Mauss: On the other hand... Summit1g said he wish they timed the wipe so that it was before COD, because he probably won't get into EFT now as a result of the timing
[04:08:33.597] Mandibull: @gunvash subs are allowed to post links, proceed :)
[04:08:43.464] Gunvash: @Mandibull Thanks!
[04:08:46.288] UncleFoodCBC: @suicide_george Screenshot that and get back to me in a month ;) I mean, yeah there's never been a COD with a BR mode before so that helps but
[04:08:47.291] LiteralEchidna: Holy shit you’re still on Tarkov? Thought we would be on Hellblade.
[04:08:52.201] SpinfoR: smoketvHey smoke smoketvHey chat here to smoketvLurk
[04:09:02.090] RedC0ldRiver: cod will just be a month long phase
[04:09:05.578] Gunvash: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_3ZBEvAyzc&t=9s All reflex sights are shooting low right now. Broken like ironsights
[04:09:08.254] RynoDabs: @LiteralEchidna he doesnt wanna play it with it being choppy
[04:09:11.843] bradswolf: I kinda like the way this game looks with this helmet. Strangely.
[04:09:14.587] ReavaN_: @Smoke Have you ever raged and screamed at someone, ever? xD somehow I can't imagine u do it
[04:09:15.075] SquidleySpooch: @Smoke itemize your time lost on stream for them and your average income, and present them with that as a number for compensation to start with
[04:09:19.323] TheRedZealot: @SuigenGaming You're mostly right. But most services dont actually keep proper records and most will favor giving you some free stuff in favor of fighting it I know our company poicy when I worked in a NOC was providing up to 30% of the mouth back for free if needed. Cause it was cheaper than finding a new customer
[04:09:42.928] SpinfoR: @Smoke there is spinOC
[04:09:46.026] MegaGigas: score!

[04:25:02.963] weinerwill12: @zephbro preach brother
[04:25:06.784] SquidleySpooch: 10/10
[04:25:11.586] Parulsc: If you're using the AK i say the 5.45 are the best, if you plan on using 5.56 just use an M4, if you plan on using the 7.62 they are pretty good too if you can get recoil low
[04:25:17.178] KittenOnTwitch: ohnTen
[04:25:20.141] ZokAliPok: @bloodcrush No - they use different ammos ect.
[04:25:44.928] bawlsmcnasty: ak 101 is honestly not bad for 5.56

[04:26:14.247] MADCheeser: @Smoke and finally someone not playing black ops lol
[04:26:16.962] ZokAliPok: @bloodcrush But for the same ammo type the stats you can get to pretty much the same, so it comes down to which ammo do you like to use more than anything
[04:26:18.632] bawlsmcnasty: like people hate the ak101 because you cant turn it into a laser beam but its still good

[04:27:22.918] NipTheTip: ded server
[04:27:27.220] ZokAliPok: @bloodcrush like I personally love the 105 because it's smaller and great in factory, or the other small variants - the 101 is really fun if you are practicing point fire headshots, AKM and 103 stuff uses the heavy duty death bulletys but instense recoil
[04:27:27.445] Parulsc: @howdy8x its the altyn face shield :)

[04:27:55.020] MegaGigas: Factory is a ghost town
[04:28:00.082] ZokAliPok: @bloodcrush The AK-74M is probably the all around viable gun for recoil, dmg, mods, ect
[04:28:09.822] JazzCabbage_: as usual Kappa
[04:28:10.584] SquidleySpooch: guy behind you

[04:28:20.861] schaefferbmw: let's be honest you would own it regardless
[04:28:26.377] ZokAliPok: @bloodcrush You can put scopes on it, sights, or both
[04:28:30.746] SquidleySpooch: why do i even bother

[04:29:13.056] SkiNty_ZA: I hope they change the scav behaviour as soon as you press the mouse button, they turn into flash gordon, annoying as hell
[04:29:36.901] Parulsc: For most of my reflex sights I just set them to the max range because the sights are all shooting pretty low right now
[04:29:40.036] ZokAliPok: @bloodcrush try them all out and see what you like - AKMs are my favorite, but you really gotta learn to get good with their recoil. They melt people but you'll miss a lot of shots

[04:32:13.818] dnt80: anyone played hellblade in VR?
[04:32:20.271] ZokAliPok: @bloodcrush A lot more dmg, but you really don't ever want to full auto it until you are basically in point fire submachcine gun range. I use it like a submachine gun with taps at long ranges - you can't full auto it at range at all if you want to take your target down. However youll just obliterate people in CQC

[04:38:55.934] Fyhre: idk whether to get EOD edition or BO4
[04:38:58.254] ZokAliPok: first time I've seen the 102 on him
[04:38:59.105] UncleFoodCBC: @averagestonername Even if consoles could handle the game, the UI and inventory would be a mess without mouse and keyboard
[04:39:13.039] terryflapz: no bitty FeelsBadMan
[04:39:28.160] UncleFoodCBC: @averagestonername I mean, IMO anyway

[04:42:33.974] J4mr0ck: when i lived in new york verizon fios was nice, steady reliable gigbit for $80
[04:42:38.834] Parulsc: most ISPs inherit the lines that were there previously, they're supposed to upgrade them and stuff but sometimes they don't
[04:42:43.441] Bocky_2D: yes is it
