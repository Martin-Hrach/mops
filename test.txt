[05:18:59.315] Pofeloost: chat is amaz help mox yet?
[05:18:59.670] mangelbuks1: ye, but you also have to spend ALOT of time and ressources in order to level up your snipers and potentially get hardcore rekt in missions before they reach their full potential
[05:19:00.072] toms595: also the experimental weapons pistol lets a sniper restealth, very useful
[05:19:00.910] supatzi: you can always switch weapons between characters
[05:19:06.902] Maewe: 2 snipers are not situation, its the main damage, I have reaper to scout ahead so I can always take shot with the area OW thingy (forgot thee ability name)
[05:19:22.955] toms595: i feel snipers are easiest to level, they rarely get shot at
[05:19:23.225] Maewe: dead zone

[05:19:26.924] Icepyro19: @amazhs if they call you sure shot shouldn’t you be good without the scope too?
[05:19:51.286] ProbeG: you should save the superior repetaer for a reaper
[05:20:15.842] javs2311: sureshot just means he def takes the shot, not actually hits the shot LUL
[05:20:19.338] mangelbuks1: They rarely get shot at - you have to rely on your other squadmembers to always perform then. If you get 1 bad encounter, you are done for with too many snipers, imo. Unless its VERY late, then snipers are godtier, yes
[05:20:24.651] YunYun1337: If I can I bring 3 grenadiers on every mission.Having the explosives and range is just too good.
[05:20:42.663] Campiclatch: sure shot - he definitely got shot, rip

[05:21:53.297] Saturmio: Zappa / \ BrainSlug
[05:22:01.435] mangelbuks1: Nothing to do with being reckless, you can just always get into a bad situation - missing a 90% shot etc.

[05:24:30.650] mangelbuks1: @Laxaeus7 nope you dont. ofcourse you play the best you can, trying to pick off targets and not pulling multiple grps of enemies. What Im saying is you can NEVER guarantee you wont end up in a bad situation due to shots missing etc. Therefor versatility is important as well and spending squadslots on leveling your multiple snipers can prove fatal

[05:44:19.985] ninjaofv: height advantage is so nice
[05:44:25.812] Maewe: give your sniper extended magazine module

[05:44:55.830] toms595: i think he has the sniper perk that makes ur shot count as single action?
[05:45:13.306] javs2311: headshot kills are free actions
[05:45:13.911] supatzi: think lost kills as a refund not as +1 action
[05:45:29.698] toms595: pretty sure it used to be +1
[05:45:48.304] toms595: so snipers would just pistol spam
[05:45:53.438] maxkata57: killing the zombies with your guns take no action (headshots) Btw your sound is distorded
[05:45:54.801] matadorjack: Headshot refund your action point if you kill a lost

[05:46:11.282] toms595: standart sniper rifle is 2 actions tho
[05:46:34.459] okiknow: only chosen rifle have it
